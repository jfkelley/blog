In high school, our headmaster once gave a brief speech about what he called "righteous indignation". He wanted it to be a theme for the school year, and said he hoped we would graduate with a sense for it. He believed we should deeply care about important issues, to the point of being genuinely upset about them.

At the time, I remember thinking this was a strange value to be extolling. It didn't particularly fit with the other values a school wants its students to hold. Other virtues that the faculty tried to instill in us seemed obviously good: honesty, work ethic, compassion, etc. I couldn't put my finger on it at the time, but righteous indignation seemed like the odd one out. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and ended up not dwelling on it too much. If anything, it seemed like it ironically justified the student body's periodic whining about the school administration itself.

But I was thinking about that speech again recently, and I think I should have listened to that feeling that it wasn't right. The problem is with the second half of the phrase: indignation. Since it is a negative emotion, it stems from some problem; something wrong with the world. In taking pride in our indignation (however righteous), we reinforce the focus on the problem, and not on a search for a solution. There's a temptation to pat ourselves on the back for being aware of a serious issue and caring about it, without actually doing anything to help the situation. And no, I don't put much stock in "spreading awareness". That's often a cop-out to allow oneself to shield one's ego without accomplishing much. This kind of impotent offense-taking is disgustingly common on social media.

But then whence cometh righteousness? Perhaps we should focus more on "righteous deliberation" - the search for a solution to the problem. And then "righteous excitement" - to drive energy into the solution and push it into the world. I want to be passionate about something good that is happening, not something bad. I'll even settle for something bad that is getting better. Indignation has its place, but it is not a worthy virtue in itself. Righteousness is, and the passion for its implementation in the world is as well.
