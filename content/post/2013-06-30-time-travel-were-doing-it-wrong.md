I'm going to talk about time travel. This is going to get weird, but I do have an actual point at the end of it. Bear with me...

First of all, let's dispense with the "killing your own parents"-style paradoxes that everyone loves to point out about traveling back in time. There are a few ways to deal with this, but my preferred theory is that, when someone travels back in time, they actually travel to a different timeline. This fits in perfectly with the [many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.][1] As an example, say you're in timeline A, and you want to go back in time. Doing so creates a new timeline, B, branching off from whatever time you travel to. Creating a new timeline seems a little weird, but don't worry, you're continuously creating timelines all the time, even when you're not time traveling, by merely observing the universe and causing waveform collapses. ANYWAY, now you're in timeline B, and by some butterfly-effect freak accident, you kill your parents. Do you disappear? But then you would have never traveled back in time, and so your parents would still be alive, so you would travel back in time... STOP. Don't be ridiculous, that's clearly not how it works. You obviously won't ever be born in timeline B, but you were still born in timeline A, which is where you came from, so that's fine. Now we've got a timeline A that is continuing on without you, and a timeline B that is progressing with your incompetent meddling. But to think you were able to create a contradiction in the universe? Hubris!

One of my math textbooks has a line in it that applies here: "The reader should think about these matters until he or she is comfortable with the distinction." How delightfully condescending! But hey, you're the one that killed your own parents, not me...

Now, a second paradox: why have we not already met time travelers? If time travel is invented at some point in the future, no matter how distant, wouldn't people be traveling back in time to our present? Where are they all? Is it just that we are unlucky, and no time travelers have ever ended up in our timeline? Hubris again, I say! You think we're just lucky? There will definitely be a lot of time travelers going back in time; who wouldn't want to? Maybe we don't have that many [jobs][2] any more, what with the economy the way it is, but obviously tons of people will still want to right some wrong or just go on a vacation! And inevitably, some will stay in the past, and those people will have kids, and those kids will grow up, and they'll eventually travel back in time, and some of those kids will stay in the past, and they'll have kids, and pretty soon every time line is filling up with time-travelling families and their grandchildren that are older than them. There will be exponential growth, but all at once! It's a real problem and will definitely be a strain on our society and resources. But as soon as things get bad enough, people will stop wanting to come back here, so it should level out once all periods of time are exactly equally overcrowded and shitty. What a bright future! Of course, there is the [anthropic principle][3], but that is inconvenient and so I choose not to consider it until it becomes useful to me (like when arguing against a divine creator). But I digress!

The initial resolution to this paradox is to suggest that traveling back in time just isn't possible and will never be achieved. But then this whole post is pointless, [which it clearly isn't, as I'm making a lot of good points here][4]. The other possibility is that time travel is possible, but requires some sort of "receiving" component to exist in the destination time. So we will eventually be able to travel back in time, but only as far back as the first moment that time travel was invented.

Well, that still kind of sucks for us. I think it's unlikely that we'll invent a time machine within our lifetime, especially now with the knowledge that it involves at least two components: a "sending" and "receiving" machine. That's way too advanced for our stupid society. Hell, people are still _mailing letters!_ However, there is a silver lining! The trick is that we don't have to invent all of it now. We only need to invent a receiving machine, switch it on, and then we will instantly begin receiving people from the far future traveling back in time to meet us... or kill us and take our precious water reserves ("oceans", <del>they called them</del> we call them, in <del>their</del> our time)... hopefully meet us. Yes, you should definitely trust anyone brave enough to be the first person to step through a time machine, and they will, obviously, be bringing with them knowledge of how to build the sending component, which we can immediately get to work building, and then bam! Time travel achieved!

So wake up, sheeple! Stop wasting all of your time and energy trying to invent a whole time machine... it's useless! You only need to invent the receiving end, which is probably way easier! And you'll know immediately if it works or not. If you switch it on and nobody from the future pops out, you've obviously screwed something up, dummy! Get to it, physicists!
