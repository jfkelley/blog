The following is something I wrote a few months ago and I'm still not sure why I wrote it. I think it was mainly just a way of organizing my thoughts on a topic I had been thinking a lot about: writing as a way of thinking. Regardless, I never really did anything with it, but I figured this blog might now be an appropriate place to put it. A word of warning - it's pretty opinion-y, and contains a lot of my own personal biases, so I don't plan on doing a lot of posts like these, but here goes anyway:

Our university system has a serious case of multiple personality disorder.

Two months ago, I graduated and sat through a handful of inspiring speeches, encouraging us recent grads to do great things in the world, to contribute positive things to global society, to be better people, etc., etc. I was very impressed and moved by all of them, but now that I've adjusted to a new life outside of school, and I've had some time to process all of it, I realize that most of what I was told feels pretty useless. The lofty ideals presented by Stanford did not match up at all to my day-to-day life - neither my life as a student, nor as a graduate. There was a complete disconnect between the past four years of my life, and these ceremonies that were intended to sum them up.

The problem with Stanford, and probably a lot of other schools, is that it has two separate, and largely contradictory sets of goals. On the one hand, there's a very nebulous, lofty group of ideas, like creating well-rounded individuals, providing an educated populace, or education for its own sake, that drive the school from the top. On the other hand, there's a very simple, but unwritten idea that the whole point of an education is simply to enable students to attain a well-paying job.

I can give dozens of very specific examples of times when the university taught me something, or gave me some advice that was directly relevant to getting a job. There was career counseling, numerous career fairs, many opportunities to meet with industry professionals, and in my computer science classes, many statements by professors that started with “when you're a professional software developer...” There was no class explicitly on how to be a better citizen, or how to have a global impact.

And yet, almost nobody ever came right out and said it, that the job was the point. In fact, the only person I can ever remember actually doing just that was my dad. He was the president of the board of trustees at my high school, and so gave a speech at my high school graduation ceremony. In it, he made a very simple statement: “the point of college is to become a productive member of society.”

At the time, I don't think many of my graduating class gave that much thought. Some of my peers criticized the speech as being very simple and very concrete. They regarded it as vacuously true, and so did I, to a lesser extent. It's interesting, though, that even before getting to college, we all already had this idea embedded in us that a job was the goal. Again, it was rare that this was ever explicit, but everyone knew it.

There's certainly a cycle at work here that I think creates this weird ecosystem: graduates from top universities get out, get good jobs, give money back to the school, have kids, tell their kids that education is the most important thing in the world, then send their kids back to those same universities, and the cycle continues. If you make the cycle explicit, if you make the job the explicit end, this whole machine falls apart. Suddenly, both kids and parents start questioning whether education is really the best thing to put above all else, or whether higher education really is the best thing for them; after all, high-stress, high-paying jobs aren't for everyone. Maybe some people want to be mechanics, or park rangers, or policemen, or any other job that doesn't necessitate a top-tier college degree, and that's just fine. So then the university takes on its key role that causes the whole problem: convincing the students that education is not only a practical good, but a moral and philosophical one as well. When the smartest people at the places with all the smart people are telling you that Stanford, or Harvard, or Princeton are the most important places in the world, and that getting an education there is the best thing you ever did because, well, just because!... you're going to believe them.

But then the focus of the university has to match that, so you get humanities, you get distribution requirements, you get classes on ancient civilizations, on race and ethnicity, on feminism, and on a myriad of other subjects that aren't likely to land you a job, but are designed to make you a better person, by whatever haughty metric the school decides. And don't get me wrong, these are all great, worthwhile classes. The world needs intellectual pursuits for the sake of themselves. We need well-rounded, well-educated citizens, and research unfettered by capitalistic incentives, and every other completely valid goal these universities describe. It all makes sense, but when the rubber hits the road, I'm not totally convinced that the system is practicing what it preaches.

In most of the last decades, I suspect that this wasn't much of a problem, but now we have some serious unemployment issues. There are tons of college graduates that I think feel cheated. They're saying “hey, where's my job?” and the universities are replying “that was never part of the deal.” The notion of a good education for its own sake used to be correlated with job prospects so strongly that it seemed like causation, but recently this has been breaking down.

I feel that universities need to stop living a double life, and address this. They could decide, simply, that they're a liberal arts school or a research school, and their intention isn't to provide you with a job, but be clear about this, and make sure that it's true, soup to nuts: have no professor ever start a lesson with “you'll need to know this when you have a job in this field.”

Or, they could decide the opposite, explicitly. Be a vocational school, and again, do it soup to nuts. Don't bother with liberal arts or a global focus. Teach your students real practical knowledge, and only that.

Or even be explicit about doing both! Put it up front, “you can either focus on the practical, and we'll try to get you a good job, or you can focus on something less practical, and we'll try to teach you that way. But don't expect to do one and get awesome results in the other.” A school like Stanford could implement this _tomorrow_. It's all about being clear about intentions and goals and making sure that students don't take job prospects or a well-rounded education as a given.

It's not just the colleges that need to change, either. High school education and below is a mess - even the top “prep” schools. For me, the whole idea of a prep school is pretty disgusting. If your school's main/only metric for success is how many kids you send to elite universities, then there's bound to be some pretty heinous consequences. I'm sure most of us could go on for days about all of the problems with this level in the US education system, but I don't really have any good solutions to offer, so I won't. I wish there was a way to entirely shift the priorities and incentives of these schools, and of all high schools, but that's a much bigger bag of worms.

And lastly, I think everyone – the kids, the teachers, the parents, and the administrators – need to admit that higher education isn't even close to the only worthwhile path. Sure, it's a great one, and I think it was the perfect path for me. I couldn't feel more blessed to be in the position that I'm in now, but I feel like that's only because I just dodged a couple big bullets. We're creating some really skewed perspectives on life and on what it means to be successful and what it takes to be happy, and there's a lot of unhappy young people because of it.
